# Bandage

Learnable 2023 Standardization test solution where I was expected to build a full E-commerce website frontend in two weeks using specific tech stack which include the following:

## React + Vite

This template provides a minimal setup to get React working in Vite with HMR and some ESLint rules.

Currently, two official plugins are available:

- [@vitejs/plugin-react](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react/blob/main/packages/plugin-react/README.md) uses [Babel](https://babeljs.io/) for Fast Refresh
- [@vitejs/plugin-react-swc](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react-swc) uses [SWC](https://swc.rs/) for Fast Refresh

## Redux Toolkit

Redux Toolkit is a comprehensive library that simplifies and streamlines the process of managing state in React applications using Redux.

- **Key Features:**
createSlice: A concise way to define Redux slices (reducers, actions, and initial state) in one place.
- **Immutability helpers:** Automatically handles immutability, reducing boilerplate code.
- **ConfigureStore:** Simplified store setup with built-in middleware and optimized performance.
- **CreateAsyncThunk**: Facilitates asynchronous data fetching with generated action creators.
- **Opinionated defaults:** Encourages best practices and clean code.
- **Purpose:** Enhances developer productivity and provides a smoother experience for global state management.

## Redux Toolkit Query:

Redux Toolkit Query is an extension of Redux Toolkit that focuses on data fetching and caching.
- **Key Features:**
- **createApi:** Generates API endpoints with automatic caching, retries, and normalization.
- **Automatic query lifecycle management:** Handles loading, success, and error states.
- **Built-in caching:** Reduces redundant network requests.
Integration with Redux Toolkit: Seamlessly integrates with existing Redux codebases.
- **Purpose:** Simplifies data fetching, improves performance, and promotes efficient API interactions.
  

Together these tools create a robust and efficient state management solution for this project, allowing the focus on building features rather than dealing with boilerplate code.
